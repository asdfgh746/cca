Classy Class App 
===

A service to allow for awesome timetable tracking as well as related school sillies. 

We're creating this service for ourselves. The features are being developed based on our needs (though, if you come up with something crazy awesome, we'd love to hear about it).

This is a good project for those of you looking to get involved with web app development, or software development in general, using an open source project. We're more than happy to have others pitch in and bolster their skills working on this service. Plus, you get the added benefit of being able to add stuff that helps you out.

Development will occur on GitHub. We're using [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) to organize our Git usage (master is stable, and deployable, use named branches to develop specific features in). We're using [issues](https://github.com/asdfgh746/cca/issues) to handle all idea collection and discussion, and [pull requests](https://github.com/asdfgh746/cca/pulls) to handle the development of said ideas.

This project uses Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.2. Check out the Gemfile for more specific versions.

Love,  
Lucas, Edward, and John

*Note:* The project name is still a work in progress. If you'd like to suggest something better, we're all ears. :smile:
